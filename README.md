## History of Vanguardum

The history of *Vanguardum* spans millennia, beginning with the formation of the first primitive civilizations. Over time, these civilizations united into massive galactic empires, fragmented into numerous factions, and engaged in countless wars. The development of space travel and advanced technology has continually shaped the political, social, and economic landscapes of the universe.

### Early History
- The first known civilizations emerged on the planet **Solara** in the **Wyrn Galaxy** over 25,000 years ago. They developed rudimentary space travel and began to explore nearby star systems.
- The **Great Expansion** marked a significant turning point, with civilizations spreading across the galaxy, leading to the establishment of the **Unified Empire** — the first galaxy-spanning government.

### The Fragmentation
- Over time, the **Unified Empire** began to fracture due to internal strife, corruption, and rebellion. This led to the **Great Fragmentation**, where the galaxy broke into smaller, independent factions. The **Stellar Regime**, **Voidborn Collective**, and **Quantum Confederacy** were some of the major powers to emerge during this period.
- The collapse of the Unified Empire and the rise of new factions set the stage for countless conflicts, which continue to this day.
